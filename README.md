# bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis: 
In this analysis we are looking into how the bikeshare business works in NYC and create a proposal on how it would work in Des Moise. 

To convince investors that a bike-sharing program is a solid business proposal, we create a bike trip analysis in tableau.

## Results:

### Results of Visualizations: 

- From the first chart (Checkout Time For Users) we found the the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and the checkouts are normally done between an hour time.
- As for the second chart (Checkout Times by Gender) to graph the length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender and found that the highest amount of bikes checked out were by males followed by females and unknown gender. 
- In the third chart (Trips by Weekday for Each Hour) the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day and found that the highest peak hours of the day were at 8 am, 5 pm and 6 pm. 
- In the fourth chart (Trips by Gender (weekday per hour)) we get the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week and found similar to before that the highest peak hours of the day were at 8 am, 5 pm and 6 pm, but also the highest gender that is taking these trips are males.
- In the fifth chart (User Trips by Gender by Weekday) that shows the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by each Usertype. 


## Summary: 

From this analysis in tableau we have found that there would be a steady flow of customers for most weekdays and there will be a high amount of males having use for the bikesharing services so it could be the best gender to target for marketing pursposes. 

Also from our the analysis on the start and ending station of bike journeys we found that the highest use of the bikesharing services is around the most touristic areas and this would be the best places to have the stations most accesible to customers. 

However, two visualizations that would be good is possibly doing an analysis as well for Des Moines, check to see what are the most touristic areas and if there are any other bike sharing services currently in the city.
